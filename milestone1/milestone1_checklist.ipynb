    "    - [x] Will you be targeting a specific kind of text among those available on the site? \n",
    "        - [x] If so, how will you be filtering the texts to just the kind you want?\n",
    "        - [x] Is there enough data there to create a \"Brown-sized\" corpus?\n",

    "You can get bonus points in this milestone by having a particularly compelling proposal, one which, for instance, has the potential to answer research questions, service an under-resourced language or group, or otherwise be applied usefully beyond this course (training data for an important task, for instance). Projects done in languages other than English, using less obvious sources of data, and involving synergy between annotation and metadata are more likely to get these bonus points. Discussing similar corpora that are available might be useful to convince us that your corpus is going to be something special."
