# Interannotator Study - Discussion

## How reliable is the annotation?
It is not very reliable due to the nature of crowd sourcing approach as well as the nature of the task. Some factors that may have reduced the reliability of the annotation:
- We cannot guarantee the annotation was done after completely reading and understanding the instruction given.
- Annotation labels are general. Although our intention is to capture the general aspects mentioned in the course reviews, this kind of generality makes annotation prone to subjectivity.

## What can be done to improve?
With enough time, it is best to train individual annotators on the task to ensure annotation quality.
