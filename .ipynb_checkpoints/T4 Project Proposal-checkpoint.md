### Coursera review study

#### Background

With the development of internet and especially under the situation of CONVID-19, people are switching from offline to online to work and study. Online study helps people get educated by the well-known institutions and improve their lives for family and communities. Hence choose the right course is particularly important.

People tend to read reviews from the others to learn about the relevant course. That's the reason why we plan to do Coursera review analysis to help people to understand the course in a much easier way (at a glance in stead of reading hundreds of thousands of reviews and get lost.)


#### Methodology

1. Collect review data from Coursera
    - to check if the size is big enough for analysis;
    - if not, try to collect reviews from other course sites and combine;
    
2. Data Preprocessing

3. Annotation
    - Course delivery
    - Assignment
    - Difficulty
    - Job hunting
    - Update frequency
    - ...
    
#### Visualization

1. keyword searching by course
2. Word cloud
3. Annotation chart
