from published research articles and also highlights how these
concepts were applied to conclude the results stated in the article.

6398d03e2d93999d5a9398acaafa0877,"I was glad to have had the opportunity to take this course.  History texts,books need to be corrected and this course would be very useful for Grade 7, 8 and above.  With regards to a specific ongoing battle out in the East Coast between the Miqmaq and the commercial fishermen - I am thinking that anyone who applies for a commercial liscence re fishing, hunting, logging, and any kind of resource extraction should HAVE to take a similiar kind of course as part of the liscensing process BEFORE they get their liscence. Hopefully something like this might deter events escalating to the point that they have out East. Gchii-miigwetch to all the intsructors, elders, artists and others who contributed to this course. I quickly caught the word indoctrination in one review and yeah if you have to see it that way -  it might seem to be the only way to correct and move forward from the harm done by colonization."

I have spoken with many Aboriginal people, including Inuit, and have wondered why there is such a difference between folks from different areas. Now I know some of the answer.I especially appreciate the Aboriginal concept of everything on earth working together for the good of everything. I also appreciate how sexuality was handled--inclusion and pride vs. exclusion and shame, the way I have seen many people handled. What a disgrace to European ideals.There are a few editing errors which do not take away from the content. I'm glad I finally had the time to finish the course.

Doesn't make any effort to speak clearly, tone of voice is that the subject matter is beneath his genius, he's only ""teaching"" the course because Duke ordered him to teach it. Disappointed. I just copied down the curriculum then watched it on Khan. Sal Khan speaks clearly and covers the same boring 10 minute lecture in a lively half the time. Thanks anyway Coursera"

A lot of undercurrents and stereotypes and reservations are not always obvious to me, as well as the reasons behind things being the way they are, so this was a great compilation of resources for me to start on my own journey of understanding the overwhelming impact of colonialism on my life and lives of others. I have already recommended this course to others and will continue doing so to those who look for starting this process.

1e567dc6b987f5819447f62c18910123,"This course is absolute garbage.  You get no feedback on your quizzes or assignments and the professor is one of the most boring I've ever seen. It's absurdly frustrating to repeatedly fail without any feedback as to why you're failing. The lectures are clearly from a math perspective, as the prof simply draws what he's talking about on the slides. His hand writing is poor, and he does a lackluster job of explaining what exactly he's doing.Finally, pure lecture with no notes is almost impossible to learn, as there's nothing to read and study.I'd rate this course a 1/10, take the course on iTunes from Caltech instead."

6eb15be3f227e1a081e34ef21ea1f788,"This course is aimed primarily at people
who wish to write about scientific research with many examples from the science
field. However, it is also useful for improvement of general writing skills because
it covers grammar and punctuation; writing in the active voice; pre-writing;
the writing process and editing, among other topics. The process for writing scientific
manuscripts e.g. methods, figures, discussion and results are very helpful (especially
for newcomers). The course gives guidance on other relevant
topics e.g. plagiarism and authorship; grants and writing letters of recommendation.
In less depth, there is advice on speaking to the media and using social media to
spread scientific knowledge."

b5e4cae2f21c5de8d47023da054a5074,"This is not a course for beginners nor will it take the short amount of time advertised.  You will need to do the extra reading so be ready.  The course starts basic but quickly progresses.  I am a middle-aged executive of a wealth management firm.  Behavioral Science is a hobby for me.  I will tell you to read books and listen to podcasts first.  I think this was a half-assed effort on behalf of the professors and terrible management and marketing job by Coursera.  In the third quiz, the professors clearly gave up on teaching.  On all quizzes, their egos were very apparent to show how much they knew and not teach us, students.  The job of teachers is to teach and then test absorption.  You will find terms in here not taught.  So you will need to read on your own.  The examples are so basic that when you get to quizzes, additional reading is necessary to understand how topics and concepts apply in the real world.  Quiz questions are also subjective enough that there are other right answers, but they want you to pick the best answer through their perspective.  I have a ton of respect for teachers and appreciate good ones.  I believe the professors of this course are good teachers.  It does not show here.  It seems as though they tried to make a course suitable for Coursera and they missed the mark.  There is a big gap between what they teach and what they test your absorption."

It is loaded with important information for teachers and tutors, as well as for parents of children with dyslexia. In the past, I have taken university level courses in order to gain teaching qualifications in Special Education, and they weren't nearly as in depth in the area of Reading and Writing difficulties as this course was. I also enjoyed using some of the practical tools they provided (albeit I wanted more of them). I am grateful for having taken this course and will continue to refer to my notes in my daily practice."

040303ab171d3be49284043da0af3d6e,"Well structured content course which is easy to understand even for a beginner in the field and which allows a first excellent overall view of Food & beverage management thanks to very accurate video lessons, but at the same time simple and clear in the exhibition. From the titles used for each module you will immediately understand what we are talking about, just think that the first module is titled: ""Products vs. Markets"". The same slides you will be able to use will report key concepts and their definitions in order to simplify the study and make it more immediate. A lot of attention is paid to the visuals offered both in the lessons and in the slides which makes it possible to make learning intuitive through practical examples. During the lessons there is the possibility to put oneself to the test with short optional interactive quizzes aimed at testing one's own understanding in view of the final exam. This certainly offers a great hand to deal with it and better, I therefore advise you to do them. You have the opportunity to listen to the experience of various successful food & beverage entrepreneurs and to understand in practice how different marketing strategies have been put to use and what results they have given. A course that combines theory and practice because, if you wish, you can also decide to try to solve specific questions asked by the teacher to test your acquired awareness at the end of each module. To make it more accessible to all, the possibility of subtitles in various languages ​​is not obvious. Learning is fast because it's exciting."

Outstandingly simple elucidation of such complex functions of the NS as homeostasis, higher abstract functions, sensation and voluntary movement provides an extensive outlook of human brain and mind in terms of every day life.

almost every aspect of human behavior. The structure of the course is carefully

If the student does the work, then the lectures, and quizzes will support them in a substantial way. The quiz is well designed to measure what the student learned in that module. There were some audio issues in the beginning where the audio was wrong, but if you studied hard, you can still choose the correct answer.This is not a course that can be casually studied, in order to do well, practice is necessary. I appreciate this course and look forward to the next level."

b3ea6a73c18957fd4b28a6c047580a28,"This class was ... not good. I took the entire class and even did the work to get an honors certificate.  There are two things wrong with this class:The professor is trying to teach this more as a freshman, first college class, blow your mind sort of experience than an actual class where students actually learn things. The issue is that he is so interested in doing that that he gives students so much incorrect information, he presents currently debated subjects in Social Psychology as settled and he lectures on things he is obviously not qualified to.For instance, he claims that violent video games cause violence. This has been repeatedly debunked since the 1990s and is not thought of as a plausible theory nowadays.  To take another example, Professor  declared(without evidence) that sex is just a category that people have made up with no basis in reality. Not only is this obviously incorrect but Professor  provided no evidence for this and he is clearly not an expert on that matter(he is a Social Psychologist, not a philosopher, biologist or geneticist).He is clearly just trying to provoke a reaction by presenting ""facts"" in an authoritative manner than actually teaching real social psychology.That is the first large problem.  The second large problem is that there is an obvious political bias to this class and the professor is trying to get his students to proselytize it. For the two honors assignments(pick 1 for credit) you could either:Try to get someone to vote for your political candidate in the 2020 presidential election(it is obvious which candidate the professor was trying to get his students to agitate for) or2. Try to convince a group of your acquaintances of the realities of certain ideologies taught in the class.  Complete with a set of leading questions that were over the line of being ridiculous.I was shocked when I saw these and now I am appalled at such blatant attempt to use a position of authority(professor) to try to influence politics in a Social Psychology Course.  A Psychology Course! That is utterly inappropriate and the professor should be ashamed.To conclude: If you want to learn about the field of Social Psychology, do not take this course. If you want get fed wrong facts in an authoritative tone, take this course.  If you do not want to get proselytized at about various issues the professor cares about, do not take this course.  If you want to get ridiculous assignments that include open electioneering in a Social Psychology course, take this class."

At the end thank you very much coursera and our renowned mentors, I hope we might meet again with the help of these type of nice courses."

I really appreciated that it provided an intersectional perspective on feminism and its history, and I learned about key events in more detailed ways than I'd heard about them previously. I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested In the history of feminism and how it connects to feminism and social justice today."

I hope this will increase my versatility as a leader, improve my relationship skills and the way I communicate. During these months of difficulties due to the virus, I have tried to not lose the motivation and the will that has always guided me, and I am happy to have learned some management tools for the next challenges that I hope will arrive soon. Having the intention of becoming an entrepreneur in a foreign country, there are many aspects to consider, and thanks to this course I had a roadmap to deal with both cultural and operational differences. The materials provided are absolutely valuable and I am sure I will come back to read and review them often. SDA Bocconi really has excellent courses."

En fin Excelente."

It was a pleasure attending his class.This course helps you understand the workings of people's minds and your own mind too. I would absolutely suggest this course to everyone. The assignments are fun and enlightening while not being too difficult or too time consuming.
523b43f241869a5dbd772c677a48aa13,Help on topics is very limited.  Nothing more than instruction videos.  Discussion forums are helpful only to solve assignments.  There is hardly any input from instructor about genuine theoretical questions.

Muy claro, organizado, completo, práctico y con recetas sencillas.Me gustó la forma simple de explicar los temas difíciles como química, biología.No me pareció muy coherente que quitaran el almidón de la pasta y después la volvieran añadir en polvo en la receta de spaguetti.Está focalizada para poblaciones de 1er mundo con acceso a servicios de calidad (luz, agua pura, colegios, hospitales de calidad)  y productos órganicos (consomé) ... haría falta un curso climatizado para latinoamérica , de hecho es necesario, cuentan conmigo para ayudar."
ad98358e3759ce9233b044c2c73bf03b,I really enjoyed this course from start to finish. Dr. Scanga is an excellent educator and takes the time to thoroughly explain difficult concepts. I really enjoyed seeing the lab demonstrations along with the lectures. I also enjoyed that a bit of Medical Anthropology was introduced in week 6 through the 2 interview-style segments- it really helped to understand why assessing and diagnosing pain in patients is so complex. Would highly recommend this course!!

He is an excellent teacher who not only explains the concepts but also discusses the origin and use of the mathematics being developed. He does this is such an engaging style that motivates to not be afraid and jump in and learn more. I would love to take more courses with this professor. I highly recommend!
