"I was glad to have had the opportunity to take this course.  History texts,books need to be corrected and this course would be very useful for Grade 7, 8 and above.  With regards to a specific ongoing battle out in the East Coast between the Miqmaq and the commercial fishermen - I am thinking that anyone who applies for a commercial liscence re fishing, hunting, logging, and any kind of resource extraction should HAVE to take a similiar kind of course as part of the liscensing process BEFORE they get their liscence. Hopefully something like this might deter events escalating to the point that they have out East. Gchii-miigwetch to all the intsructors, elders, artists and others who contributed to this course. I quickly caught the word indoctrination in one review and yeah if you have to see it that way -  it might seem to be the only way to correct and move forward from the harm done by colonization."

Thank you"
"I truly appreciated learning about Aboriginal history and culture. I have spoken with many Aboriginal people, including Inuit, and have wondered why there is such a difference between folks from different areas. Now I know some of the answer.I especially appreciate the Aboriginal concept of everything on earth working together for the good of everything. I also appreciate how sexuality was handled--inclusion and pride vs. exclusion and shame, the way I have seen many people handled. What a disgrace to European ideals.There are a few editing errors which do not take away from the content. I'm glad I finally had the time to finish the course. I can't get some of the points out of my mind!Thanks so much for letting me take this course."

I for one will be eager to enrol."
"Audio is weak. Bendich is probably a good researcher, but not a good teacher. Doesn't make any effort to speak clearly, tone of voice is that the subject matter is beneath his genius, he's only ""teaching"" the course because Duke ordered him to teach it. Disappointed. I just copied down the curriculum then watched it on Khan. Sal Khan speaks clearly and covers the same boring 10 minute lecture in a lively half the time. Thanks anyway Coursera"

I was lucky enough to find this course by Professor  . Personally, I think this is the most complete course to introduce you to psychology. Pr.  gave an overall view on psychology that will help you, by the end of the course, to talk about so many subjects you weren't aware of before. Huge thanks to Pr., Yale university and Coursera for providing this amazing experience and journey."

"Most of the description was about the back story of the topic and the ending was abrupt without a proper wrap-up. This was a little off-putting since the Rating of the course was quite high. The professor is good and his speech is quite clear and composed which is the reason for the 3 star rating.However, these mixed feelings have thrown me into a dilemma whether to purchase a certificate or not."
"Aweome, detailed and crip with relevant theory and formulae."
"thank you coursera"
"The corse is really good. If you had mathematics some time ago and wish to get started again, this course is for you. The last two modules are much better than the first two ones, but I guess it's still a work in progress. Feedback and answers make a huge difference. I learned quite a lot reviewing my own mistakes with the help of the answers.."

The thought of many quizzes and essays did scare me initially, but it helps the student/learner to recap on the information presented. Professor   is great at teaching/sharing and I would readily watch these again. Unfortunately the live Q&A (?) sessions are not suitable for my timing so I've not attended those before. I hope that more people will discover the wonder of the universe with this course and a greater appreciation for the stars."

"This course was absolutely amazing and eye opening. I am an immigrant and therefore the only narrative that is readily available for me is the one of settlers. A lot of undercurrents and stereotypes and reservations are not always obvious to me, as well as the reasons behind things being the way they are, so this was a great compilation of resources for me to start on my own journey of understanding the overwhelming impact of colonialism on my life and lives of others. I have already recommended this course to others and will continue doing so to those who look for starting this process.

"I'm very new at this theme, this course has being the perfect beginning. If you don't have a mathematical background and you don't understand when the funny S appear, this is the course for you!"
"This course is absolute garbage.  You get no feedback on your quizzes or assignments and the professor is one of the most boring I've ever seen. It's absurdly frustrating to repeatedly fail without any feedback as to why you're failing. The lectures are clearly from a math perspective, as the prof simply draws what he's talking about on the slides. His hand writing is poor, and he does a lackluster job of explaining what exactly he's doing.Finally, pure lecture with no notes is almost impossible to learn, as there's nothing to read and study.I'd rate this course a 1/10, take the course on iTunes from Caltech instead."
"The content and methodology of the course were great. The study material was well chosen and even experts on women's rights can learn a lot in this course due to the variety of topics covered in this course."

This course helped me redefine my ideas and take a new perspective on several issues such as: prejudice, stereotypes, biases, sexuality, evil, obedience, conflicts, love, among others. I highly recommend it! All the concepts learned during the course can and must be applied to our everyday life! We definitely can build a better and more peaceful world!"

"A nice and flexible coure, in which you can explore the wide range of poibilitie from the minimum baic level of ubject to tudying all the additional material and problematic.

A wealth of  information was provided. I will be going back over my notes and referring to the detailed  resources provided.Thanks"
"This course is aimed primarily at people
who wish to write about scientific research with many examples from the science
field. However, it is also useful for improvement of general writing skills because
it covers grammar and punctuation; writing in the active voice; pre-writing;
the writing process and editing, among other topics. The process for writing scientific
manuscripts e.g. methods, figures, discussion and results are very helpful (especially
for newcomers). The course gives guidance on other relevant
topics e.g. plagiarism and authorship; grants and writing letters of recommendation.
In less depth, there is advice on speaking to the media and using social media to
spread scientific knowledge."
"I started this course without having any knowledge about Psychology, but the professor was very talented and intelligent, he has the way to explain difficult things (such as brain system) in a very good way and I can understand this quite well. After I finished the course, I can understand my life and peoples mind better and I have more confidence to take another Psychology class in advance. I have a good feeling every time I attend the class. Thank you very much."
"I want to congratulate the organizers of the course. As a Biological and Health Sciences teacher, it is an extremely important tool that I will know how to transmit all the learning obtained to my students. As a mother and a family member in charge of preparing food, she has given me tools and tips that I consider of great value. Thank you Stanford for the opportunity to grow."
"I found this course very absorbing, and Professor  very engaging, with an infectious enthusiasm for his subject. I have enjoyed learning more about evolutionary theory, the growing awareness of evolutionary changes due to domestication, and the methodology and techniques used to identify and measure strengths in dogs.  I'd have liked to continue to learn more about Dognition and other projects which are studying animal intelligence and behaviour.Thanks very much for a most enjoyable course."

"I thoroughly enjoyed taking part in thi coure. The module covered a multitude of divere branche of philoophy which helped me to broaden my knowledge of the ubject overall and the lecturer were incredibly helpful in explaining imply, and with ueful example, new information. The coure ha further deepened my love for the ubject and the platform of aement were challenging, but did not feel labourly. I would without a doubt recommend anybody, regardle of former experience of the ubject, to partake in thi coure and I am highly glad to have had the experience."
"This is not a course for beginners nor will it take the short amount of time advertised.  You will need to do the extra reading so be ready.  The course starts basic but quickly progresses.  I am a middle-aged executive of a wealth management firm.  Behavioral Science is a hobby for me.  I will tell you to read books and listen to podcasts first.  I think this was a half-assed effort on behalf of the professors and terrible management and marketing job by Coursera.  In the third quiz, the professors clearly gave up on teaching.  On all quizzes, their egos were very apparent to show how much they knew and not teach us, students.  The job of teachers is to teach and then test absorption.  You will find terms in here not taught.  So you will need to read on your own.  The examples are so basic that when you get to quizzes, additional reading is necessary to understand how topics and concepts apply in the real world.  Quiz questions are also subjective enough that there are other right answers, but they want you to pick the best answer through their perspective.  I have a ton of respect for teachers and appreciate good ones.  I believe the professors of this course are good teachers.  It does not show here.  It seems as though they tried to make a course suitable for Coursera and they missed the mark.  There is a big gap between what they teach and what they test your absorption."
"Impressive content and awesome delivery by a distinguished and awarded Professor with incredible speakers that inspires me to do better in finance application in uplifting the less privileged with the use of finance and IT by disrupting the incumbents in less developed economy like the Philippines. As a veteran finance executive with global experience this refresher course is interesting more so with it's altruistic vision. I would like to hear more from  Schiller on the strategies to move forward with his visions."
"This is such a well laid out course! I love the interactive videos and case studies and have learned so much these past few weeks."
"Vraiment cela a été une excellente occaion pour moi peronnellement d'explorer le monde et la culture francophone tout en étudiant la langue, la grammaire et d'acquérir le connaiance néceaire à l'examen DELF B2"

"This content of the course are worthy but little bit old.  It was created in 2015 but missed to update with latest scenarios.  This brand management topic is very much important one so it demands up to date contents to understand them and make wise decisions based on knowledge gained from this MOOC. The professor   explains the concepts very well without boring. I love very much his way of teaching with little bit of smile all the time. Thanks to coursera for bringing me this wonderful lifetime opportunity of learning from the places where people like us not even able to see.  Heartful of thanks to you.  You break all the knowledge sharing barriers in this society with your organization.  Definitely it will pay off in the near future.  You will see the dramatic positive changes  in the society which you sow with your organization."
"I really enjoyed the compoition of the coure. Multiple ide of Circular Economy are touched in a very attractive and informative manner. The tak are moderately demanding that make the coure more intereting. Very well tructured coure and great knowledge hared! Thank you."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this course! I didn't think it was going to be as in-depth and useful as it ultimately was. It is loaded with important information for teachers and tutors, as well as for parents of children with dyslexia. In the past, I have taken university level courses in order to gain teaching qualifications in Special Education, and they weren't nearly as in depth in the area of Reading and Writing difficulties as this course was. I also enjoyed using some of the practical tools they provided (albeit I wanted more of them). I am grateful for having taken this course and will continue to refer to my notes in my daily practice."
"Nice introductory information. I do wih it had gone more in depth in certain topic, like common dieae, biology, and treatment, but it wa a decent firt look at vet work. I am glad they covered thing like client iue, working with the public, and the tructure of exam. I enjoyed the focu on the Dick chool' hitory, and Edinburgh' place in veterinary hitory. It' cool to ee an online coure that focue on the chool' unique tanding in the topic covered. Thank you for offering thi cla!"
"Interesting lectures. The information is relevant and the examples are very helpful. Offers add and demo of navigation cards.
Thank you very much to the whole team"
"Well structured content course which is easy to understand even for a beginner in the field and which allows a first excellent overall view of Food & beverage management thanks to very accurate video lessons, but at the same time simple and clear in the exhibition. From the titles used for each module you will immediately understand what we are talking about, just think that the first module is titled: ""Products vs. Markets"". The same slides you will be able to use will report key concepts and their definitions in order to simplify the study and make it more immediate. A lot of attention is paid to the visuals offered both in the lessons and in the slides which makes it possible to make learning intuitive through practical examples. During the lessons there is the possibility to put oneself to the test with short optional interactive quizzes aimed at testing one's own understanding in view of the final exam. This certainly offers a great hand to deal with it and better, I therefore advise you to do them. You have the opportunity to listen to the experience of various successful food & beverage entrepreneurs and to understand in practice how different marketing strategies have been put to use and what results they have given. A course that combines theory and practice because, if you wish, you can also decide to try to solve specific questions asked by the teacher to test your acquired awareness at the end of each module. To make it more accessible to all, the possibility of subtitles in various languages ​​is not obvious. Learning is fast because it's exciting."
"Great course about general principles of process mining! It gives many insights. Consiation of PM tools is very useful. Thanks!"

"Very interesting course where you learn how to analyze cryptographic constructions. I love the way is taught, building on top of basic constructions until you implement real-world systems. I certainly got interested in cryptography many times, but always dropped the courses before the end. This one got me hooked all the way!. The programming assignments were great to assimilate concepts. Well done!"
"  did a great job with this course. I can't imagine the number of new things I have learned as regards content creation. I didn't just learn, I was able to put into practice what I have learned making it stick. Thank you,  , UAC, and Coursera for giving me this opportunity to grow professionally."

The provided reading documents were very informative again broadening my knowledge. Thank you to MOMA,  and coursera for providing this course.  Look forward to learning more."
"I found the information provided by this course to be exactly what I needed and it was presented well. There were also plenty of references provided for going deeper if necessary. I didn't like the disjointed nature of the quizzes, you're asked questions about the information that appears later in the course. Maybe the idea is to encourage you to go back and retake the quizzes but I found it frustrating. I would recommend the course to anyone who may need to understand more about psychological first aid."

"A wonderful course. A range of curious topics which is interesting. Very good teaching materials. A lot of surprising information throughout the course. Emotional content as we learn that the contemporary world has people like us who suffer to the maximum extent for being a woman. Thanks to Dr.    for this excellent course and for taking us from week 1 to the end of the course to week 10, through various organizations and personalities we met in this course. I found the utmost sincerity in the course contents. Thank you to everyone involved in this course."
"I have really enjoyed the last 7 weeks that I have studied Social Psychology. My motivation for studying this was to be able to analyse and know how best to build and maintain relationships.

I would recommend anyone to take up courses on Coursera for personal development, you won't regret it.   is an amazing Professor, I enjoyed my lectures and will sure miss them."

"Dr   is a fantastic guide to the world of neurobiology. Outstandingly simple elucidation of such complex functions of the NS as homeostasis, higher abstract functions, sensation and voluntary movement provides an extensive outlook of human brain and mind in terms of every day life. Since I really look forward to becoming a neuroscientist or cognitive scientist
myself, this course has become a firm starting platform for my spaceship of ambition
to take off from. I now feel a desire to research the neurobiology of everyday life in
almost every aspect of human behavior. The structure of the course is carefully
balanced and is aimed at providing a wide, yet detailed scope of knowledge for
beginners like me to understand the importance of the NS. Thank you so much the team and Dr.  as well as coursera for giving me the opportunity to take part in this course! See you soon!"
"Course is too good"
"It was a very challenging course, and I learned a lot.  Thank you to the professor and staff."

"Very helpful"
"This is a very good beginner course that requires the student to practice, practice, practice. If the student does the work, then the lectures, and quizzes will support them in a substantial way. The quiz is well designed to measure what the student learned in that module. There were some audio issues in the beginning where the audio was wrong, but if you studied hard, you can still choose the correct answer.This is not a course that can be casually studied, in order to do well, practice is necessary. I appreciate this course and look forward to the next level."
"it is awesome"
"Extremely insightful course. I like the modules about Rawls and Nozick. The last module about democracy  a bit of hasty. I hope the Professor will make another course about democracy."
"This course gives you a perfect overview at introductory level. The course units and time spend on different aspects are balanced, the material used is supportive, and I enjoyed the way the teaching staff engaged in this course. A next interesting step could be how to deal with all the new developments in science (such as open access, FAIR procedures, etc) and their meaning with regards to the quality of reviews."
"Very good course ! Quite tricky at times (especially for beginners) but I really enjoyed it !Many thanks to the instructors & mentors ! :)"
"This is the best MOOC I've done till now."
"It’s a practical and very effective too. Gives new ideas and guides how to apply it too. Thanks for such  a valuable and well designed one. I feel it could be more precise and crisp too as sometimes I had problem reading the transcript.  Transcript could be shown on screen during the lecture as it could be easy to relate it then"
"I am awed by the construct and workings of the human body after taking this course. The instructors and course material were top notch! Highly recommended."
"I have to be grateful to the University of Pennsilvania, Coursera, because I achieve my first on line course. And my special thanks to the teachers, thank you very much.

I have a degree in Chemistry, and teach Earth Science and Chemistry to high school students, so my knowledge about science for this course is up to par, but I like that it adds a LITTLE more info, and it's going to give me a chance to bring stuff back to my students. The text book is amazing, and the videos are on point. Thanks for a great class!"

Coursera is a treasure and opportunity for anyone looking to continue their education.  If this course is any indication of what the others courses are like, I am hooked."

Kudos."
"Great!"
"Very good coure very informative learned lot."
"Amazing course! I enjoy every video, every interview. Professor is cool, a professional . I like that you provided not only the theory itself, but also informative slides, interviews with so interesting people, plus gave/showed visual examples. Videos are of great length (not too long, not too short), information is valuable and only on business. I had a great , kinda , customer experience studying your lectures)) And its more than lectures, its a joy. Thank you for your job!"
"Had to pend hour on the internet daily to olve problem et, the video are of low quality. lack of exercie and real content.It would have been more beneficial if thi coure focued more on concept rather than math given that it a beginner coure."
"Great course!"
"This was a great course. The only part that could be improved would be to add some new content about the tech available now, as the videos about this are dated."
"For someone who had no knowledge of the Chinese language, this course has taught me so much. I've had an opportunity to practice my pronunciations and everyday conversations with the native speaker without even knowing anything in Chinese beforehand. I've gained confident to further my knowledge in the Chinese language. This course was very fun and detailed."
"This course has been life changing. I urge anyone who feels like they are too caught up in things around them to take this course and learn how to look at everything around us and within us in a new light."
"The course has truly been helpful in showing me my level of understanding on the topics, as like all the other reviews it was a great refresher and more so it was truly helpful in helping me see areas i needed to improve on to become more advance in mathematics. i definitely recommend this course for those who want an understanding of the mathematics that is used in data science. this course by no means is an all you need math course to be successful with data science, but more of a stepping to stone or guide in my opinion in finding the right path to take to become far better in mathematics for this field."
"I thoroughly enjoyed the course , as I came know the process , techniques , and concept building of great masters.  is a wonderful instructor , going into every small detail ,Ihad watched his videos on you tube before the course also ,. I learnt a lot , the course is very well planned , and gives a lot of flexibility too."
"I was reluctant to pursue  this course in the beginning but once I started viewing videos which are encompassed with very informative contents laid an indelible imprint on my mind. It is indeed an avenue of effective and efficient teaching and learning pedagogy."
"Looking forward to advanced courses on Linear algebra, eculidean geometry that would make the concepts of vectors, matrices, plane and any application of those in the data science problems."
"Increíble las oportunidades que se dan en esta plataforma, muy didáctico y traducido para en este caso mi lengua materna."

It doesn't only teach writing techniques, but also gives insights regarding the organization you are in, how to be part of a team, how to advocate your service and the ethics that every professional content marketer should be aware of. It also gave me a clear and good background in strategic marketing. It is simply great. I recommend it to anyone who wants to truly understand marketing."

The mot important thing about the coure would be that the intructor were able to actually relate the ort of abtract idea of philoophy to actual ground realitie. Thank you!"
"This class was ... not good. I took the entire class and even did the work to get an honors certificate.  There are two things wrong with this class:The professor is trying to teach this more as a freshman, first college class, blow your mind sort of experience than an actual class where students actually learn things. The issue is that he is so interested in doing that that he gives students so much incorrect information, he presents currently debated subjects in Social Psychology as settled and he lectures on things he is obviously not qualified to.For instance, he claims that violent video games cause violence. This has been repeatedly debunked since the 1990s and is not thought of as a plausible theory nowadays.  To take another example, Professor  declared(without evidence) that sex is just a category that people have made up with no basis in reality. Not only is this obviously incorrect but Professor  provided no evidence for this and he is clearly not an expert on that matter(he is a Social Psychologist, not a philosopher, biologist or geneticist).He is clearly just trying to provoke a reaction by presenting ""facts"" in an authoritative manner than actually teaching real social psychology.That is the first large problem.  The second large problem is that there is an obvious political bias to this class and the professor is trying to get his students to proselytize it. For the two honors assignments(pick 1 for credit) you could either:Try to get someone to vote for your political candidate in the 2020 presidential election(it is obvious which candidate the professor was trying to get his students to agitate for) or2. Try to convince a group of your acquaintances of the realities of certain ideologies taught in the class.  Complete with a set of leading questions that were over the line of being ridiculous.I was shocked when I saw these and now I am appalled at such blatant attempt to use a position of authority(professor) to try to influence politics in a Social Psychology Course.  A Psychology Course! That is utterly inappropriate and the professor should be ashamed.To conclude: If you want to learn about the field of Social Psychology, do not take this course. If you want get fed wrong facts in an authoritative tone, take this course.  If you do not want to get proselytized at about various issues the professor cares about, do not take this course.  If you want to get ridiculous assignments that include open electioneering in a Social Psychology course, take this class."
"Thi coure ha opened my mind to ee ecurity holitically, with their deep influence in the ociety, conidering ocio-economy, political and technological apect, among other. A a caveat, the coure intructor are varie greatly in term of the teaching quality, you have a almot perfect module about Illicit trade and a poor module about Open Source Intelligence, for intance. Evaluation could be more creative, frequent and challenging during all coure week."
"This course is a great introduction to Heritage Management. It course a wide range of topics and the example used are extremely relevant. The atmosphere created by the professor is pleasant and seeks to open discussions. I would totally recommend this course whether or not one is planning to work in this industry! Nevertheless, one may find the quizzes slightly too easy"
"I have learned how to apply the things learnt in this course to analyse and interpret public health data. The course is full of examples explaining all the concepts in simple language."

In this course we have learned about how to write resume with explanations, how to write cover letter and how to face interview I such a formal and polite way with their interviewer. At the end thank you very much coursera and our renowned mentors, I hope we might meet again with the help of these type of nice courses."
"I particularly loved how the coure wa taught o conceptually. There were no trict method or formulae to mug up and follow. The homework quetion were very timulating. I found the depth reached in addreing the concept jut perfect for an introductory coure."
"This course was so informative! I really appreciated that it provided an intersectional perspective on feminism and its history, and I learned about key events in more detailed ways than I'd heard about them previously. I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested In the history of feminism and how it connects to feminism and social justice today."

"I am really happy to have used this time of the covid to deepen these topics that follow part of my previous degree course. I hope this will increase my versatility as a leader, improve my relationship skills and the way I communicate. During these months of difficulties due to the virus, I have tried to not lose the motivation and the will that has always guided me, and I am happy to have learned some management tools for the next challenges that I hope will arrive soon. Having the intention of becoming an entrepreneur in a foreign country, there are many aspects to consider, and thanks to this course I had a roadmap to deal with both cultural and operational differences. The materials provided are absolutely valuable and I am sure I will come back to read and review them often. SDA Bocconi really has excellent courses."
"Gracias por el curso, me sirvió para aprender y para repasar otras tantas cosas, todo muy interesante, desde recordar los nombres de las barras, hasta recordar que se puede mostrar el apuntador en modo presentación y sin olvidar el repaso de Excel en sus fórmulas básicas que te hacen querer estudiar más a fondo tablas dinámicas y macros. En fin Excelente."

"Thi coure helped me undertand mot of the information hared from within. But it remain unclear why or how ome arbitration may be binding. That concept need further explanation, ince ome arbitration may be dimied or overruled. I do not know why ome arbitrated caed are final and cloed, but other arbitrated cae move to litigation. I alo do not undertand why different arbitrator would deliver different opinion or deciion over one cae, were they aked. Pleae hare your thought regarding thi.

"Amazing introductory course and covers wide variety of topics ranging from history, to astronomy to astrobiology. Really great of amateur astronomers and for anyone who is remotely interested in it."
"This course very informative and also entertaining at times ;-)Professor   is the best teacher you can get. It was a pleasure attending his class.This course helps you understand the workings of people's minds and your own mind too. I would absolutely suggest this course to everyone. The assignments are fun and enlightening while not being too difficult or too time consuming."
"Help on topics is very limited.  Nothing more than instruction videos.  Discussion forums are helpful only to solve assignments.  There is hardly any input from instructor about genuine theoretical questions."
"Felicidades , me encantó el curso. Muy claro, organizado, completo, práctico y con recetas sencillas.Me gustó la forma simple de explicar los temas difíciles como química, biología.No me pareció muy coherente que quitaran el almidón de la pasta y después la volvieran añadir en polvo en la receta de spaguetti.Está focalizada para poblaciones de 1er mundo con acceso a servicios de calidad (luz, agua pura, colegios, hospitales de calidad)  y productos órganicos (consomé) ... haría falta un curso climatizado para latinoamérica , de hecho es necesario, cuentan conmigo para ayudar."
"I really enjoyed this course from start to finish. Dr. Scanga is an excellent educator and takes the time to thoroughly explain difficult concepts. I really enjoyed seeing the lab demonstrations along with the lectures. I also enjoyed that a bit of Medical Anthropology was introduced in week 6 through the 2 interview-style segments- it really helped to understand why assessing and diagnosing pain in patients is so complex. Would highly recommend this course!!"
