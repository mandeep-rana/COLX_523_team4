"This course offers a great refresher of the FUNDAMENTALS of Linear Algebra , Calculus and Probability. Do note the strong emphasis on fundamentals. All lectures are well produced and the material put forward in an unambiguous and layman language. The concepts presented are very easy to grasp , all thanks to the brilliant efforts of professor Bendich and professor .This course , along with another course on Calculus would serve as a great starting point for all data science enthusiasts and I strongly recommend it to everyone."

"Easy-to-unstand with useful examples, and also process mining is a technique that is applicable to many cases."
"I highly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in exploring the field of Forensic science. The learning and practicing processes were truly enjoyable, especially taking the quizzes and solving the cases. I hope I have the opportunity to sign up for another course of this type very soon."
"Very challenging and a lot of theories - I will have to go through the deck of slides again and make better notes.Learned a lot - thank you, !"
"Brilliant course. Only thing that could have made it better was some sort of back and forth with the instructors when I had questions, but hey I signed up for an online course and it was executed beautifully. Highly recommend this course for anyone working with data in Excel!"
"Thi i an excellent coure! Every healthcare provider hould take up thi coure!"
"This course is a well written and structured course i have taken an ""introduction to forensic science"" course before but it was not as good as this one was. The website i took my course on was https://www.futurelearn.com/ it was an okay course but the accent was very difficult to understand. If you were to take a forensic science course take this one first i reccomend you to take the class on this website."
"This course has a very confusing layout! The ""rewirements"" are sometimes presented before the course material is presented, so when you try to do them, they reference things you haven't learned yet.  Also, you are often asked to skip forward to videos for future weeks, but so much time at the beginning of those videos is spent on recap (again, recap of things you haven't learned yet!) that it's hard to weed through to get to whatever is supposed to be relevant. There are good ideas here for sure, and good science, but seems like they are less confusingly and more entertainingly presented in TED talks that I've watched. I have only done two weeks of this class, but I'm not going to finish for these reasons."
"I enjoyed taking this course. The instructor was knowledgeable in his field and the materials were resourceful. And I liked that it was self-paced. I enjoyed the peer review tasks as well as applying the lessons learned in my immediate environment. It was all together, a beautiful experience. Thank you   Kazdin!!"
"The lessons are very substantial to beginning parents and educators. This course exceeded my expectations and corrected misconceptions about parenting."
