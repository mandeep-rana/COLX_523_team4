"This course is really interesting, especially for people that are into Business Management and Psychology. In my humble opinion, every human being is a decision maker in their everyday life and this course( in conjuction with other sciences) is a tool of paramount importance to make better and more effective decisions in the everyday life. I feel really happy to have had the opportunity to learn all that i have learned and become a better decision maker starting from..now!"

"Excellent beginners course in Mandarin.  The teacher introduces new words using pinyin in each 3-4 minute lesson and the content is reviewed in a quiz.  The content is limited to reading and pronouncing pinyin words, which is perfectly acceptable to me since I'm supplementing this course with other in person classes.  I love the 4 minute classes 4 times per week, since I never felt like I'm so far behind the deadlines that I can't catch up."
"It was definitely a bad idea to take up this course as my first MooC I took seriously. Professor  J. ’s course was too well-structured, consistent and practical, and have raised my MooC expectations level so high, that now, being absolutely hungry with massive online education, I face certain difficulties in finding a course to keep to the same level. But I go on believing that it's possible. As for the practical application of the knowledge obtained - it’s too early to make conclusions, but having tried some techniques in reality, I find them very helpful. What’s also great: now, getting a bit deeper in some of the issues raised by the course, say, negotiator’s decision making psychology, I find out that what I see in 10 different sources, had already been covered by this only course. And the final practical task was a bit of mind-blowing for me. In a good sense. Thank you very much for the experience!"
"The course seems to follow its own advice for using multisensory learning, for the most part. I was able to review quite a lot of the information because of its frequency throughout the course. Some quiz questions seem a little vague or semantic. I would like to be able to review the quizzes and add them to this feedback."
"The way material is presented and the cource pace is perfect. After lessons the topics are clear and there will be much more understanding why all those crypto libraries are built like they're built, and how to use them even in case the API is not elegant and is error prone. Can't wait until part II!"

"This course was perfect for me as I hadn't taken calculus since 1970 as an undergrad. I needed the algebra and trigonometry tune-up that is provided at the beginning, and thereafter the material flowed beautifully. Thanks to Professor  for his relaxed yet rigorous style. He incorporates just what I wanted, an appreciation of mathematics as an art. Bravo Professor! Michael Leahy, Chicago, Illinois USA"
"how did it help to develop your action items to
develop your content marketing strategy? It really helps me to come up with creative headlines to
grab attention of the audience. Before I had troubles grab users' attention and
wondered why is my content not being viewed by many people? So, I started with
the customer persona and I have realized, I didn't have a clear audience. And
that really surprised me. When I had a clear goal of whom to deliver my
message, it was a game-changer. My blog views have increased by 8.4% after using the
strategy of content marketing. In the era of the internet, this course has
provided me tons of valuable information that is practical. I'm surprised that
the internet course can bring such fruitful lessons if one has a strong
dedication. What ideas did you gain from the course and will implement
it? ""Empathy map"" and ""Experience map""
is a key thing that I have learned in this lecture. And more importantly,
applying in a real-life situation boosted my competitive advantages. Realizing
how to write meaningful and fascinating stories is a mind-blowing experience.  What are you already doing well? Where do you need to
strengthen?  I love the fact that people all around the world give
constructive feedback on my project. People love my contents and stories behind
them and find them really interesting. It is a great feeling when I can be like
an artist and deliver the beauty of content to
the audience. However, I have missed delivering a clear ""call to
action"". I have learned that persuading people to take action is key
to the revenue stream. And it will be my ongoing mission to strengthen
this point. plus the
course helped me in understanding the numbers behind my audience's behavior
with the use of data and metrics from my Google Analytics account. My learning
objects were exceeded with this Strategy of Content Marketing course."
"Excellent course, very well conducted by the lecturer. Comprehensive and in-depth presentation of the six main topics. Multiple media and sources utilized ( Slide downloads, alumni interviews, additional reading/viewing material etc.). Thank you for the course :-)"
"Es un curso muy bien orientado, y el método de enseñanza es excelente. El profesor te enseña a pensar más allá, lo recomiendo para todos los niveles."
